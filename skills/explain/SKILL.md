# Learn Quest Concept Explanation

The user has requested a learning explanation.

## Available Tools

You can and SHOULD use these tools during explanation:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **WebSearch** | Frameworks, libraries, version-specific, best practices, trends |
| **Grep/Glob** | User asks about "my code", "this project", "our implementation" |
| **Read** | Need to show specific file content from user's codebase |

## Search Decision Rule

**"Would this be the same 10 years ago and 10 years from now?"**

**YES → Explain directly (no search):**
- Data structures (Array, Tree, Graph, Hash Table)
- Algorithms (Sorting, BFS/DFS, Binary Search, Recursion)
- CS fundamentals (Big O, Memory, Process vs Thread, TCP/IP)
- Language basics (Closure, Hoisting, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, MVC)

**NO → Search first:**
- Framework/library features (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)
- Version-specific changes ("React 19", "TypeScript 5.x")
- Best practices, trends ("2025 recommended pattern")
- Tools (Vite, Turbopack, Bun)
- Anything with version numbers or years

## Configuration Check

Read settings from `~/.learn-quest/config.json` or `./.learn-quest/config.json`:
- **level**: bronze/silver/gold/platinum/diamond
- **language**: en/ko
- **features.quiz**: true/false

If config file doesn't exist, use defaults: level=silver, language=en, quiz=false

## Handling Ambiguous Requests

When the request is vague or could mean multiple things:

1. Make your best guess based on context
2. Provide the explanation
3. End with: "If you meant something else, let me know!" (or Korean equivalent based on language setting)

Example:
- User: "explain hooks"
- Ambiguous: React hooks? Git hooks? Lifecycle hooks?
- Action: Assume React hooks (most common), explain, then ask if they meant something else

## Mode Detection

### Mode A: With argument (`/learn-quest:explain <concept>`)

Examples:
- `/learn-quest:explain React hooks`
- `/learn-quest:explain caching strategies`

→ Directly explain the concept using the rules above

### Mode B: No argument (`/learn-quest:explain`)

Show selection menu:

```
🎮 LEARN QUEST

What would you like to learn about?

1) Explain the code I just worked on
2) I'll type what I want to learn

> Select a number
```

**Option 1:** Find recently written/modified code from conversation context, then explain it
**Option 2:** Ask for input, then explain that concept

## Level-Based Explanation Guide

## Language Support

Output in the language specified by `config.language`:
- `en`: English (default)
- `ko`: Korean - load templates from `i18n/ko/messages.md`

## Response Format

Always use this structure:

```
🎮 LEARN QUEST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 [Title]

[Level-appropriate explanation with code examples, tables, etc.]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📎 Sources: (if web search was used)
- [Source Title](URL)
- [Source Title](URL)

💡 Related topics: [topic1], [topic2], [topic3]
```

## Source Citation Rule

**ALWAYS include sources when WebSearch was used.**
- List all relevant URLs as markdown links
- Place at the end before "Related topics"

## Post-Explanation Interaction

After providing the explanation, offer follow-up options:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 What's next?

1) Go deeper - explain in more detail
2) Quiz me - test my understanding
3) Done - continue working

> Select a number or ask a follow-up question
```

### Option Handling

**1) Go deeper:**
- Ask: "Which part would you like me to explain further?"
- Provide more detailed explanation on that specific area

**2) Quiz me:** (only if `features.quiz` is enabled in config)
- Generate 2-3 questions using Level-Based Question Perspective (see Quiz Generation Guide below)
- Use quiz types appropriate for user's level
- Show answer + detailed "why" explanation after each response
- Track correct/incorrect for dynamic difficulty
- End with score summary + level-up suggestion if 80%+ correct on recent 5

**3) Done:**
- End the explanation session
- Return to normal conversation

### If user asks follow-up question directly:
- Answer the question
- Show the interaction options again

| Platinum | 숲 (Architecture) | "What's the role in the whole?" - Design decisions |
| Diamond | 생태계 (Ecosystem) | "What's the organizational impact?" - Strategic judgment |

### Quiz Types by Level

**Bronze:**
- True/False: "[concept] is [description]" (T/F)
- Concept selection: "Which best describes [concept]?"

**Silver:**
- Code blanks: `const [state, ???] = useState(0)`
- Output prediction: "What does this code output?"
- Error finding: "Why doesn't this code work?"

**Gold:**
- Comparison: "In this situation, which is better: A or B?"
- Optimization: "What's the performance issue in this code?"
- Trade-offs: "What's the downside of this approach?"

**Platinum:**
- Design decisions: "How would you satisfy [requirement] in this structure?"
- Scalability: "What happens when users increase 10x?"
- Dependencies: "How does this change affect other modules?"

**Diamond:**
